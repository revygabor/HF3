# HF3

This is my solution for the deep learning class 3rd homework. 
The task was to make weather predictor using a feedforward neural network.

1. I present the the course of the solution in the [training_and_testing_model](training_and_testing_model.ipynb) notebook.
2. The desired predictions for 26. october, 1. november and 29. november can be found in the [homework_predictions](homework_predictions.ipynb) notebook.
3. The [dataset_downloader](dataset_downloader.py) module contains the scripts to download weather data and create csv.
4. The [weather_predictor](weather_predictor.py) module contains commented code for preprocessing data, creating and training the model.
5. You can find the dataset in the [weather_dataset.csv](data/weather_dataset.csv) file
